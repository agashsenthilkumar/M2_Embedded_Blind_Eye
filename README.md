# M2_Embedded_Blind_Eye
Using ultrasonic sensor
his circuit is developed by interfacing ultrasonic sensor“HC-SR04” with AVR microcontroller. This sensor uses a technique called “ECHO” which is something you get when sound reflects back after striking with a surface.

We know that sound vibrations can not penetrate through solids. So what happens is, when a source of sound generates vibrations they travel through air at a speed of 220 meters per second. These vibrations when they meet our ear we describe them as sound. As said earlier these vibrations can not go through solid, so when they strike with a surface like wall, they are reflected back at the same speed to the source, which is called echo.
